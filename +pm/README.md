# Project Management (+pm)

This directory contains project management artifacts: product requirements, backlog items, and task tracking.

## Structure

```

└── done/                     # Completed items
    └── P50.hhhhhhh.description.md
```

## File Naming Convention

Backlog items follow this format:

```
LNN.hhhhhhh.description.md
```

**Components**:
- **L**: A-Z character for priority level (A is highest, Z is lowest)
- **NN**: 2-digit numeric sub-priority (00 is highest, 99 is lowest)
- **hhhhhhh**: 7-character hex hash (unique identifier, collision-checked)
- **description**: Kebab-case slug (a-z, 0-9, hyphens only)

**Examples**:
- `A00.a1b2c3d.document-pm-backlog-structure.md` (Absolute highest priority)
- `P50.c7d2b4a.refactor-legacy-code.md` (Standard priority, default)
- `Z99.e1f9c2b.nice-to-have-feature.md` (Lowest priority)

---

## Creating Backlog Items

### Using Scripts (Recommended)

Run from repository root:

```bash
# Create with priority and description
./scripts/create-backlog-item.sh A10 implement-feature-x

# Create with defaults (priority: P50, description: timestamp)
./scripts/create-backlog-item.sh
```

### Manual Creation

If creating manually:

1. Generate unique hash: `./scripts/lib/generate-hash.sh`
2. Choose priority (A00-Z99)
3. Create file: `+pm/backlog/LNN.hash.description.md`
4. Use standard template (see below)

---

## Backlog Item Template

```markdown
# Title: [Short Description]

## Description
[Detailed description of the backlog item goes here.]

## Priority
LNN

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Additional Requirements
[Dependencies, estimates, notes, etc.]

## Status
[Draft | In Progress | Review | Done | Cancelled]
```

---

## Workflow

### 1. Create
```bash
./scripts/create-backlog-item.sh A10 implement-oauth
```

### 2. Work
- Edit the markdown file
- Add detailed requirements
- Define acceptance criteria
- Update status as you progress

### 3. Complete
```bash
# Move to done/ folder
mkdir -p +pm/done
mv +pm/backlog/A10.abc1234.implement-oauth.md +pm/done/
```

### 4. Cancel (if needed)
```bash
# Update status to Cancelled in the file, or move to cancelled/
mkdir -p +pm/cancelled
mv +pm/backlog/Z99.xyz9876.abandoned-feature.md +pm/cancelled/
```

## Priority Guidelines

| Level | Range | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **A-E** | 00-99 | Critical, blocking, core foundation |
| **F-O** | 00-99 | High priority features and fixes |
| **P** | 00-99 | Standard priority (P50 is default) |
| **Q-V** | 00-99 | Nice-to-have, improvements |
| **W-Z** | 00-99 | Low priority, experimental, future |

---

## Hash Generation

Hashes are 7-character hexadecimal identifiers generated by `scripts/lib/generate-hash.sh`:

- **Collision-checked**: Script verifies uniqueness in +pm/ directory
- **Bash built-ins**: Uses `$RANDOM`, no external dependencies
- **Format**: Lowercase hex (0-9, a-f)
- **Length**: 7 characters (28 bits entropy)

---

## LLM/Agent Usage

When working with Cursor or other AI agents:

- **Always use the scripts** to create backlog items
- **Never manually generate hashes** - use `generate-hash.sh`
- Scripts are documented in `AGENTS.md`
- AI shall decide priority to "fit in" based on existing items

---

## PRD Integration

The `PRD.md` file contains the product vision and requirements. Backlog items should trace back to PRD requirements where applicable.

---

## Tips

- **Keep descriptions short** - slug should be under 50 chars
- **Use kebab-case** - all lowercase, hyphens for spaces
- **Be specific** - "add-login-form" not "improve-auth"
- **Track status** - update the Status field as work progresses
- **Archive completed** - move to done/ when finished
